## Plan

Bomber Online is an MMO game inspired the iconic SNES game, Bomber Man.  The game is top down and tile based featuring tile collision and destructable tiles.  The game has a range of powerups that spawn around the map giving the player a range of advantages.  In the Battle Royale gamemode, up to 10 players fight while the map size slowly shrinks.  This forces the players to move towards the centre and fight until only one player remains.
